          <h3>The front end developer</h3>
          <p>
            A recent research on how it is to work as a front end developer, follows the agile web agency <strong>Wasabi web</strong> based in Stockholm, as they work closely with companies to tailor a website or application to increase revenues and gaining’s. Their work varies from women’s training programs to websites for event arenas. In both these examples the customers have had increased sales, registrations, more visits and overall activities on their sites.
          </p>
          
          <img src="http://wasabiweb.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Telenor-Arena-webbyra-uppsala-3.jpg" alt="Wasabi web example" class="profile-photo">
          
          <p>
            The picture above is an example of what Wasabi web have done to overhaul a website to make it more attractive and inviting.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Much of this simhas tply o do with <strong>Wasabi web’s</strong> way of updating the layout and design of said websites. Using the latest design language that includes large pictures, stylish and minimalistic text boxes, saturated and warm colors, and an overall focus on making it easy to find the information that you want. A goal is to minimize the amount of mouse clicks you need to navigate through the page.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Creating a good looking website is tough work, since it’s always easy for a normal user to say whether or not a website is inviting or repulsive. For the most part, you hear the bad things more often than you hear the good. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We asked the staff at “Wasabi web” if they could answer any questions regarding their company, the experiences they have had and what it means to work as a front end developer, but sadly the people at “Wasabi web” just got in a new order of work – so they won’t be able to answer anything just yet.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The biggest challenge for the front end developer however, is the way how design trends changes constantly. Not only are there constant changes in the design department, but the software and techniques that are being used changes as well. The things that were learned last year could just as well be outdated the next year, and be replaced by something that makes the programming easier and functions more accessible.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            There is no shortage of work for the front end developer, because most companies nowadays needs a home. A website for their customers to visit and order products, acquire information on products, or simply just to contact the company on good or bad intentions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The front end developers at <strong>Wasabi web</strong> are the people that are responsible for what you see and interact with on their websites. That search field up top for example, or the little graphic that displays when you click on a chat window. In comparison, the back end developers work with everything that is behind the scenes. For example, how that search field up top that you pressed on connects to the data base, check if the word you entered exists in the database, gets the relevant information and spits it back out onto the screen through multiple connections between documents in the code.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Because of the changing climate that the programmers work in, they need something to keep it all together. For this <strong>Wasabi web</strong> are using the “Agile software development” method, used by many of the largest companies in the world, like Google – to name one of them. This is a way of working that focuses on adaptive planning, adapting to change, early delivery of products and much more. Short meetings of 5 to 15 minutes are held every morning called “Stand-up meetings” where everyone answers three key questions. The first one is “What did I accomplish yesterday?”, the second one is “What will I do today?” and the third one is “What obstacles are impending my progress?”. These meetings are essential for the whole team to be on the same page, and to come over to someone and help with any problems they might have stumbled upon.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The “agile software development” method is a way of working that mostly focuses on working closely with your customer, trying to fulfill their demands. Short snippets of the work are sent to the customer a few times a week to keep them updated on their demands, as well as the developers’ progress towards certain goals. Even if the programmers are hit by serious delays and they are behind on delivery, the motto is always to keep their customer updated so that changes doesn’t come as a shock, and to deliver a working product rather than a good looking nonworking product.

            This has been a look into the company <strong>Wasabi web</strong>, their front end developers and what that work title is all about.

          <h3>The web in the future</h3>
          <p>
            To be able to say where we think the internet will take us in 5 years or more, we must start from where we are right now. As it is right now, people are using their phones for connectivity and interaction with the internet more than people are using laptops and PCs. People even surf the internet on their gaming consoles, just out of pure laziness. We have smart watches that are connected to our phones via BlueTooth and we stream videos from our phones to our TVs. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            So, where could we possibly go from here? Personally, I think that the future will depend on wether or not governments try to restrict us, or make it even more open to us. We will most likely be able to connect our whole identities to our phones or smart watches, like our bank details or passports, paying for petrol without leaving your car to get our credit card out. Maybe even just scanning your phone against a sensor in the petrol pump. Or when your car needs to fill up with petrol, your phone will automatically give your a GPS route to the nearest and cheapest petrol station. We will also most likely be able to connect to our physical items, such as the coffee maker - being able to watch a timer on when the coffee is ready. Check our fuel level in our cars, connect to the stove or the microwave or the refrigerator.
          </p>         
          <p>
            To assume where we will be in the future with the internet, we must proceed thinking like the laziest man/woman on earth. What can we do to really minimize our physical efforts in real life? This will not necessarily mean just the internet, but also the technical advancement in our phones and such. A quick example of that could be, an updated version of IR or BlueTooth in your phone, to be able to just point your phone at any screen that you've connected your phone to, and just quickly turn the screen off or on with the click of a button. I even think that companies will advance to minimize office space, and take care of almost everything online. Connect to their work database from home, or where ever they are. This would result in internet connectivity where ever you are in the world. Working from the rain forest in the Amazon? No problem, you've got 100gb down and upload.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in short, I think the future will just mean severely updated versions of the functions we currently have on our phones. I think more items will have BlueTooth connectivity, I think that more physical items in our houses will be more and more like smart phones, and the future itself, will be even more centered around our phones and the concept of connectivity.
